# hello-world
a hello world project. Made to learn the ropes!

  I'm not too sure how to use markdown elements yet, but I'll add what I learn to this .md so that we can both watch how I progress!
  About me: My name is Liv (as you already know (probably)). I'm a big explorer and traveler, I'm definitely a sucker for live music even if I don't know the artist. 
  I love puzzles and Computer Science scratches that unreachable itch. I'm currently a sophomore at Appalachian State Univerisity.
